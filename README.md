# MindMatterTrainer
A simple Mind-Matter Trainer based on a TrueREG (https://www.tindie.com/products/ubldit/truerng-v3)

Insert your TrueREG in a USB port of your PC

Add the MMT.py and Calibration.ini files in a dedicated folder.

In the calibration.ini file choose the number of bits/sec to be analyzed and the time (in seconds) of the trial.
Launch the mmt.py from your Python GUI.

When launched, a graph will open showing the number of 0s and 1s around the expected mean.

Your task is to increase the number of 0s or 1s or maximise their difference reducing the expected entropy.

Pressinf F on your keyboard you can switch from full to reduced screen.

As output you will have the final plot plus a .csv file with all data for further analyses.

Enjoy your mind-matter skill !!
